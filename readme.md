# Three.js and Shaders Learning

This project is focused on exploring **Three.js**, a JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser, and learning about **shaders** for advanced rendering techniques.

## Topics Covered

### Three.js

- Setting up a Three.js project
- Creating scenes, cameras, and renderers
- Adding geometries, materials, and meshes
- Working with lights and shadows
- Loading textures and models
- Animating objects in a 3D scene

### Shaders

- Understanding the basics of GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language)
- Writing vertex and fragment shaders
- Using shaders in Three.js with `ShaderMaterial`
- Exploring uniforms and attributes
- Creating custom effects like water, fire, and post-processing

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd three-js
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if applicable):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser or use a local development server:
   ```bash
   npx http-server
   ```
